# Introduction

This is my journey of learning something outside of the rendering realm. It's completely an unknown to me since I didn't take the physics elective in my high school, yet I have strong interest in physics studies. In particular, physics simulation fascinates me a lot. Seeing how people can utilize computers to simulate molecular particles, fluids, natural phenomenona, even cosmic scale bodies, makes me want to explore more into the field of simulation.
